# Machine-Learning-With-Python

# Welcome!
This Machine Learning with Python course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known, programming language. You'll learn about Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning, look into how Statistical Modeling relates to Machine Learning, and do a comparison of each. Look at real-life examples of Machine learning and how it affects society in ways you may not have guessed!

Please pay attention that this course has some hands-on labs which requires that you have working knowledge of Python programming language. If you don't feel you have sufficient skill in Python programming I recommend you take Python for data science or Data Analysis with Python courses.
